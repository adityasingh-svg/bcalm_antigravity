## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool and development server.

**Routing**: Client-side routing implemented with Wouter, a lightweight React router. The application currently has two routes: a landing page (`/`) and a 404 not-found page.

**State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management and data fetching. Local component state managed with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).

**UI Component Library**: Shadcn UI (New York style variant) built on Radix UI primitives, providing accessible, customizable components. The design system uses a comprehensive set of pre-built components (buttons, dialogs, cards, forms, etc.) with Tailwind CSS for styling.

**Styling Approach**: Tailwind CSS with a custom design system that includes:
- CSS custom properties for theming (colors, shadows, spacing)
- Design tokens defined in CSS variables (HSL color format)
- Responsive breakpoints following Tailwind's default system
- Custom color palette featuring primary violet (#6a3df0) and navy (#0b132b) accents
- Typography using Inter and Poppins fonts from Google Fonts

**Animation**: Framer Motion for scroll-triggered animations, page transitions, and interactive UI elements.

**Component Structure**: Page-level components in `client/src/pages/`, reusable UI components in `client/src/components/`, and Shadcn UI primitives in `client/src/components/ui/`. 

**Landing Page Sections (in order)**:
1. **HeroSection** - Hero with headline, dual CTAs (Join Waitlist, Schedule Call), and quick links navigation bar for smooth scrolling. Spacing: mb-8 paragraph, mb-6 CTAs, mb-8 quick links
2. **CareerSupportSection** (id="career-support", py-16, mb-10) - 4-card grid showing Resume Optimization, Portfolio Building, Interview Prep, and Job Board access
3. **AboutSection** (id="about", py-16) - Program overview and value proposition
4. **CurriculumSection** (id="curriculum", py-16, mb-10) - Detailed 4-week breakdown with expandable cards showing What You Learn (bullets), Outcome, and Hands-on Assignment for each week
5. **WhyBcalmSection** (id="why-bcalm", py-16, mb-10) - Comparison table contrasting Traditional Bootcamps vs. Bcalm benefits
6. **TestimonialsSection** (id="reviews", py-16, mb-10) - 6 student testimonials with AI-generated avatars from IIT, BITS, NIT, IIIT students
7. **InstructorsSection** (id="instructors", py-16, mb-10) - 3 instructor profiles with AI-generated headshots (Google, Microsoft, AI Startup backgrounds)
8. **PricingSection** (id="pricing", py-12, mb-10) - Pricing card with ₹14,999 (special cohort price from ₹24,999), 13-item feature checklist in 2-column grid, 7-day refund guarantee, and dual CTAs. Tighter spacing for action-oriented focus
9. **CTASection** (py-12, mb-8) - Final enrollment call-to-action with compact spacing for momentum
10. **Footer** - Branding, legal links, social media, and contact information

**Generated Assets**: 10 AI-generated images including hero background, 3 instructor headshots, and 6 student testimonial avatars stored in `attached_assets/generated_images/`.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript running on Node.js.

**Server Setup**: Custom Vite middleware integration for development with HMR (Hot Module Replacement). Production builds serve static assets from the `dist/public` directory.

**API Structure**: RESTful API pattern with routes prefixed with `/api`. Currently, the route registration system is set up but minimal routes are implemented - the backend is prepared for future expansion.

**Data Storage**: In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage` class) for development. The storage interface defines CRUD operations for users, designed to be easily swapped with a database implementation.

**Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple dependency included for PostgreSQL session storage (prepared for future use).

### Data Storage

**Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with schema definitions in TypeScript.

**Database Provider**: Configured to use Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL) via `@neondatabase/serverless`.

**Schema Design**: Simple user schema with id, username, and password fields. Uses PostgreSQL's `gen_random_uuid()` for primary key generation. Schema validation with Zod through drizzle-zod.

**Migration Strategy**: Drizzle Kit configured with migrations output to `./migrations` directory. Schema push command available via `npm run db:push`.

**Current Implementation**: The application uses in-memory storage for development, but the database infrastructure is configured and ready for production use when `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is provided.

### Form Handling & Validation

**Form Library**: React Hook Form with Zod resolvers for schema-based validation.

**User Interactions**: Two primary user actions captured through dialog forms:
1. Waitlist signup (name, email, college, phone)
2. Schedule a call (same fields)

Both forms use local state, display toast notifications on submission, and currently log data to console (prepared for backend integration).

### Path Aliases & Module Resolution

**TypeScript/Vite Aliases**:
- `@/*` → `client/src/*` (frontend code)
- `@shared/*` → `shared/*` (shared types/schemas)
- `@assets/*` → `attached_assets/*` (images and assets)

This allows clean imports throughout the application without relative path complexity.

### Design System References

The visual design draws inspiration from premium educational platforms (Reforge, Maven, Product School, hellopm.co) with emphasis on:
- Clean, minimal layouts with optimized spacing (tiered system: py-16 for content, py-12 for actions)
- Premium typography hierarchy with balanced heading-to-content gaps (mb-10 standard, mb-8 for compact sections)
- Aspirational, credible aesthetic with professional, compact feel
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth animations and hover effects

**Spacing Philosophy**: The landing page uses a tiered spacing system inspired by hellopm.co benchmark, balancing compact professionalism with readability. Content sections use py-16 (64px) padding, action-oriented sections use py-12 (48px) for focused momentum, and heading-to-content gaps are standardized at mb-10 (40px) or mb-8 (32px) for tighter sections.
