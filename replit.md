## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React 18 and TypeScript, using Vite for development and bundling. Wouter handles client-side routing. State management relies on React Query for server state and React hooks for local component state. UI components are developed using Shadcn UI (New York style) built on Radix UI primitives, ensuring accessibility and customizability. Styling is managed with Tailwind CSS, incorporating a custom design system with CSS variables for theming, a primary violet and navy color palette, and Inter/Poppins fonts. Framer Motion is used for animations. The landing page is structured into multiple sections: Hero, Career Support, About, Curriculum, Why Bcalm, Testimonials, Instructors, Pricing, and a final CTA, all designed with a mobile-first, responsive approach. Key visual design inspirations include Reforge and hellopm.co, focusing on clean, minimal layouts, premium typography, and an aspirational aesthetic with a tiered spacing system for optimal readability and professionalism.

**Branding:** The Bcalm logo (orange graduation cap icon with "BCALM" wordmark and tagline) is displayed across the website in two placements: (1) Navbar - full logo at responsive size (35-45px height), clickable link to home; (2) Footer - full logo at 60px height above description text.

### Backend Architecture

The backend utilizes Express.js with TypeScript on Node.js. It integrates custom Vite middleware for development with HMR. The API follows a RESTful pattern. Data storage uses PostgreSQL via `DatabaseStorage` implementation, with a clear `IStorage` interface for abstraction. Authentication is handled via JWT tokens for the Free Resources system, with bcrypt for password hashing.

### Data Storage

**Production Database:** The application uses PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) via Drizzle ORM for all persistent data. Database schema includes:
- `users`: Basic user accounts (id, username, password)
- `resources_users`: Free resources authentication (id, email, password, name, isAdmin, timestamps)
- `resources`: Educational resources (id, title, description, category, type, filePath, fileSize, originalFileName, mimeType, isActive, timestamps)
- `download_logs`: Download tracking (id, userId, resourceId, downloadedAt)
- `assessment_questions`: 24 questions across 8 skill dimensions (id, dimension, questionText, helperText, orderIndex)
- `assessment_attempts`: User assessment sessions (id, userId, totalScore, readinessBand, isCompleted, dimensionScores, createdAt, completedAt)
- `assessment_answers`: Individual question responses (id, attemptId, questionId, answerValue)

**File Storage:** Uploaded files are stored in `uploads/resources/` directory on disk, with metadata (originalFileName, mimeType) stored in PostgreSQL for proper download handling.

**Database Operations:** All CRUD operations use Drizzle ORM through the `DatabaseStorage` class. Migrations are managed via `npm run db:push`. Admin user (admin@bcalm.org) is auto-initialized on first startup.

### Form Handling & Validation

Form management is handled by React Hook Form, with Zod resolvers providing schema-based validation. Current user interactions involve waitlist signup and call scheduling, which log data to the console, awaiting backend integration.

## Features

### AI PM Readiness Check (November 2025)

A comprehensive assessment system that evaluates student preparedness for AI Product Management roles across 8 skill dimensions. This serves as a lead generation tool and helps students understand their gaps.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **24 Assessment Questions**: 3 questions per dimension across 8 skill areas (Product Thinking, AI/ML Fundamentals, Data & Metrics, User Research, Product Strategy, Communication, Technical Collaboration, Ethics & Responsible AI)
- **5-Point Likert Scale**: Responses range from "Not yet, this is new to me" (1 point) to "I can do this confidently and explain it to others" (5 points)
- **Scoring & Banding**: Total score out of 120 points, mapped to 4 readiness bands:
  - 96-120: Internship Ready
  - 72-95: On Track
  - 48-71: Building Foundation
  - 0-47: Early Explorer
- **Autosave & Resume**: Answers automatically saved after each question; users can resume incomplete assessments
- **Start Fresh**: Users can discard incomplete attempts and restart from scratch
- **Personalized Results**: Dimension-level breakdown showing scores and gaps, with contextual CTAs based on readiness band
- **Auth Integration**: Uses existing resources_users authentication system with JWT tokens
- **Shareable Results**: Viral sharing feature for lead generation with privacy-first design

**Frontend Pages:**
- `/ai-pm-readiness`: Landing page with hero, benefits, and CTA
- `/ai-pm-readiness/start`: Intro screen with format explanation and resume/start fresh options
- `/ai-pm-readiness/questions`: Question runner with one question per screen, progress tracking, and auto-advance

### Landing Page Redesign - Three-Fold Structure (November 2025)

The landing page hero has been redesigned with a three-fold structure for improved conversion and user experience:

**Fold 1 - Hero Section:**
- **Gradient Glow**: Subtle radial gradient blur behind headline for premium visual anchor
- **Element Order**: Headline → Subheadline → Primary CTA → Secondary CTA → Social proof → Cohort info → Secondary links
- **Updated Copy**: "Become interview-ready for AI Product roles in 30 days" with "Designed for non-tech students & recent graduates"
- **Primary CTA**: "Contact on WhatsApp" button with WhatsApp icon, opens wa.me link to 919398354912 with pre-filled message. Full-width on mobile (375px edge-to-edge, sharp corners), centered on desktop (448px, rounded corners)
