Goal:
Fix the top section so that:

The header is clearly visible and static at the top.

The “Free Resources” pill CTA sits inside the header, not floating over the hero.

The overall feel is premium, clean, Apple-like.

1️⃣ Make the Header a Clear, Static Bar

Implement a <header> that is:

position: fixed

top: 0, left: 0

width: 100%

z-index: 1000

Background: solid white (#ffffff)

Add a very light bottom border to separate it from the hero:

border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.05);

Inside the header, use a flex layout:

display: flex;

justify-content: space-between;

align-items: center;

Add padding:

padding: 16px 24px; (or close)

The header should look like a subtle, defined bar at the top (like Apple/Stripe), not blend into the hero.

2️⃣ Left Side: Make “Bcalm” Visible and Strong

On the left side of the header, place the brand text: Bcalm.

Style it as:

Color: #111111 (dark, clearly visible)

Font-weight: 600

Font-size: 18–20px

Make sure it is not sitting on the dark hero background. It should sit inside the white header bar.

3️⃣ Right Side: “Free Resources” as a Pill CTA (Not Floating)

On the right side of the same header, place the “Free Resources” CTA.

It must be inside the header, aligned horizontally with “Bcalm”, not overlapping the hero text.

Design it as a soft pill:

Wrap the text in a <a> or <button> styled like this:

padding: 6px 16px;

border-radius: 9999px; (full pill)

background: #f5f3ff; (soft purple tint)

color: #6c47ff;

font-weight: 500;

text-decoration: none;

transition: 0.2s ease;

Hover state:

Slightly darker background: background: #ebe4ff;

Slightly deeper text: color: #5a38f0;

Optional very light shadow: box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);

This should look like a premium CTA chip, not like a cheap flashy button and not like plain text.

4️⃣ Ensure Hero Content Sits Below Header (No Overlap)

Right now the CTA looks like it’s floating over the hero because the hero section starts too high.

Add top padding to the main content / hero container to account for the fixed header height:

Example:

main { padding-top: 80px; }

or apply pt-20 in Tailwind.

The hero headline “Become Interview-ready for AI Product in 30 Days” should start clearly below the header, with nice breathing room.
