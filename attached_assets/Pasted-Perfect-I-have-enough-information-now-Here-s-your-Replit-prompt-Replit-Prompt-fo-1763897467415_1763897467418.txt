## Replit Prompt for Bcalm.org Changes

You are working on the Bcalm.org website, a React 18 + TypeScript full-stack application with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. Make the following changes:

### 1. **Logo Size & Positioning**
- Find the logo component in the header/navigation area
- Resize the logo to **40-48px height** (standard best practice for web logos)
- Ensure it has proper padding (suggest 12-16px) on the top-left
- Add responsive sizing: slightly smaller on mobile (32-36px) if needed
- Maintain aspect ratio

### 2. **Update CTA Button Text**
- Find the hero section component that contains the current CTAs
- Replace the text "Contact on WhatsApp" with "Contact us"
- Replace the text "Download Free Resources" with "Free resources"
- Keep all other functionality intact

### 3. **Redesign "Contact us" Button with WhatsApp Branding**
- Change the "Contact us" button color from purple to **WhatsApp green (#25D366)**
- Add the **WhatsApp icon from Lucide React** (use `<MessageCircle />` or `<Phone />` icon, whichever looks best) to the left of the text
- Maintain hover states and accessibility
- Ensure the button maintains proper contrast and readability

### 4. **Position CTAs Side-by-Side**
- Use flexbox to arrange "Contact us" and "Free resources" buttons horizontally on desktop
- Add appropriate gap spacing between buttons (suggest 12-16px)
- **On mobile:** Stack buttons vertically for better UX (use responsive Tailwind classes like `flex-col md:flex-row`)
- Ensure buttons remain clickable and properly sized on all devices

### 5. **Keep "Free resources" Button Styling Unchanged**
- The "Free resources" button should retain its current dark/grey styling
- Only the "Contact us" button should have the WhatsApp green treatment

### Additional Notes:
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling changes
- Maintain TypeScript type safety
- Ensure the changes are responsive and mobile-first
- Test the layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
