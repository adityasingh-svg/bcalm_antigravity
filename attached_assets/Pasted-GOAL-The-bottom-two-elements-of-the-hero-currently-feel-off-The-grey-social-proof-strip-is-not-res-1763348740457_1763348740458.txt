GOAL
The bottom two elements of the hero currently feel off:

The grey social-proof strip is not responsive on mobile and looks like a broken ticker.

The “Next Cohort Starts” bar is too subtle for such an important piece of information.

Redesign them so that:

Social proof is shown as a clean, responsive pill.

The cohort date is a prominent highlight card that clearly stands out.

The entire bottom of the hero feels intentional, premium, and aligned with the rest of the design.

1️⃣ Remove / Replace the Existing Elements

Remove the current narrow grey strip that shows social proof (the one that overflows / truncates text on mobile).

Remove or restyle the existing “Next Cohort Starts” pill so it will be replaced with a new, more prominent card.

We are replacing them with two new elements:

A social proof pill

A cohort highlight card

2️⃣ Layout Order at the Bottom of the Hero (Mobile & Desktop)

Within the hero, from top to bottom, the order should be:

Main headline

Subheadline

Primary CTA button — “Join the Waitlist”

Secondary CTA button — “Schedule a Call”

New Social Proof Pill

New Next Cohort Highlight Card

This order must be respected on mobile and desktop for consistency.

3️⃣ Social Proof Pill — Design & Content

Content text:

🧑‍🎓 Trusted by 200+ students from IITs, BITS, NITs, and IIITs

Design requirements:

It should be a full-width pill (but not edge-to-edge; respect page padding).

Background: very soft purple tint, e.g. #f5f3ff or rgba(131, 88, 255, 0.08)

Text color: dark grey #111111, with the “200+” slightly emphasized.

Icon: emoji or small icon on the left (e.g. 🧑‍🎓 or user group icon).

Border-radius: 9999px (full pill).

Padding:

Vertical: 8–10px

Horizontal: 12–16px

Alignment: center-aligned text on mobile; can stay center on desktop as well.

Text must wrap naturally on mobile — no overflow or clipping.


4️⃣ “Next Cohort Starts” Highlight Card — Design & Content

This card should feel like a clear, premium info block, not a footer chip.

Content structure:

Small label: Next Cohort

Main line (big): Starts: December 2, 2025

Subtext: Limited seats • Applications reviewed on a rolling basis

Design requirements:

Card should be full-width within the content container, with generous padding.

Make it visually stronger than the social proof pill, but still consistent with the hero’s style.

Suggested styling:

Background:

Option A (preferred on dark hero): #111827 or a similar dark-but-slightly-lighter-than-hero shade.

Or Option B: a very light tinted background (#f8f7ff) if you want a contrasting light card on dark hero.

Text color: high contrast (white on dark, or dark on light).

Border-radius: 16px (matching your existing card style).

Padding: 14–16px on mobile, 18–20px on desktop.

Add a small calendar icon on the left (📅 or vector icon).

Layout:

Mobile: icon + text stacked vertically or left-aligned within one block.

Desktop: icon on the left, text aligned next to it in a row with flex.

You can adjust the date dynamically later; for now, hardcode the same date you already use.

5️⃣ Responsiveness Requirements

On Mobile:

Social proof pill and cohort card must:

Respect the page’s horizontal padding.

Never clip or overflow horizontally.

Wrap text naturally without ellipsis.

Maintain clear vertical spacing:

8–12px between CTAs and social proof pill.

8–12px between social proof pill and cohort card.

On Desktop:

Elements should remain centered within the main content container.

Consider slightly increasing max-width and padding of the cohort card so it feels substantial but not overwhelming.

Typography sizes can be slightly increased (e.g. date line at 16px).

6️⃣ Visual Hierarchy Rules

Social proof pill = secondary emphasis (lighter background, smaller type).

Cohort highlight card = primary emphasis (stronger contrast, bold date text).

When you look at the bottom of the hero:

Users should first notice: “Next Cohort Starts: December 2, 2025”

Then, they see: “Trusted by 200+ students…”

Nothing should look like a glitchy ticker or a generic footer bar.

7️⃣ Clean-Up

Ensure no old CSS/JS for the previous scrolling/ticker-style strip remains.

Remove any overflow: hidden / marquee behaviour from that old social-proof element.

Confirm on real mobile dimensions (iPhone 12/13 width) that:

All text is readable

No elements are cut off

Spacing feels consistent
