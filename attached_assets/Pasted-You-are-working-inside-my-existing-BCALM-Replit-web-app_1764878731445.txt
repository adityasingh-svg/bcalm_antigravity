You are working inside my existing BCALM Replit web app. Apply ONLY the UI/visual changes below to the landing page shown in the latest screenshot. Do NOT change routing, logic, or CTA behavior. Do NOT add any new copy or sections beyond what I specify. Do NOT rewrite existing copy except where I explicitly provide replacement text.

Goal

Improve contrast, hierarchy, and premium feel while keeping “Start for Free” as the hero CTA.

1) Background + glow reduction (reduce “purple fog”)

Find the landing page background layers (radial glows, gradients, AI node/pattern overlay).

Reduce overall glow intensity by ~50%.

Any large hero radial glow behind headline → cut opacity to half or remove if stacked.

AI/node pattern overlay opacity must be 0.08–0.12 max.

Keep the same gradient colors, only reduce intensity/opacity.

2) Add a subtle hero “surface”

Behind H1 + subcopy + CTA, add a translucent panel (hero surface).

Style:

background: rgba(255,255,255,0.04)

border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)

border-radius: 20px

NO outer glow

padding: 24px (mobile), 28–32px (desktop)

This panel should wrap only the hero content, not the full width.

3) Eyebrow pill hierarchy fix

Top pill currently says: “India’s Fastest-Growing AI Interview Prep Platform”

Replace ONLY this pill copy with exactly:
“India’s #1 AI Interview Prep Platform”

Reduce pill visual weight:

font-size: 12–13px

font-weight: 500

padding tighter (approx 6px 12px)

border alpha down to ~0.2

Reduce vertical gap between pill and H1 so it reads like an eyebrow.

4) Hero copy stack tightening

Remove the faint low-contrast line below CTA (the gray-ish helper line).

Keep only:

eyebrow pill

H1

subline (“Free AI CV Score + 30-Day Personalized Plan”)

CTA

Do NOT add any replacement line.

5) H1 snap + typography polish

Keep H1 text exactly the same.

Increase letter spacing slightly:

letter-spacing: 0.2px to 0.4px

Reduce line-height:

line-height: 1.05–1.1

“in 30 Days” color should remain lavender/purple but:

remove any glow

increase brightness slightly so it pops vs background.

6) Trust block cohesion + chip contrast

Add a soft full-width strip behind trust section:

background: rgba(255,255,255,0.03)

padding-top: 20px

padding-bottom: 24px

Trust heading:

keep copy same

font-size 14–15px

font-weight 600

opacity ~0.9

Institution chips (IIT, BITS, NIT, IIM):

background: rgba(255,255,255,0.06)

border: rgba(255,255,255,0.18)

text opacity 0.9

“200+ success stories”:

increase size slightly (16–18px)

font-weight 600

opacity 1

7) Navigation alignment (no CTA change)

Top nav primary button must be exactly “Start for free” (same as now).

If “Check Your CV” appears in nav as a button, convert it to a simple text link:

label: “CV Review”

subtle style (no border, no fill)

“Sign in” remains a text link.

Do NOT add any new nav items.

8) Micro-interactions (subtle)

CTA hover:

transform: scale(1.02)

transition: 250–300ms ease-out

slightly tighter shadow (no neon glow).

Hero content fade-in:

duration 300ms ease-out

translateY(6–8px)

Institution chips hover:

very subtle lift (translateY(-1px))

slight border brightening.

9) Spacing for mobile

Reduce vertical gap above H1 slightly.

Reduce gap between H1 and subline.

Increase gap below CTA before trust block.

Rules

Do NOT add extra copy, headings, or sections.

Do NOT modify onboarding or CV flow.

Only apply these style/layout changes.

Keep everything responsive (mweb + dweb).
