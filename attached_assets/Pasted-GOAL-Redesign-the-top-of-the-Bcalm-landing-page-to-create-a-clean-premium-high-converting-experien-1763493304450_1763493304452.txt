GOAL
Redesign the top of the Bcalm landing page to create a clean, premium, high-converting experience for 3rd–4th year students and recent graduates.
We want:
A decluttered hero (Fold 1) focused on: understanding + primary action


A proof fold (Fold 2) focused on: “Why Bcalm Works” via Instructor + 10x Shortlist


A navigation/quicklinks fold (Fold 3) to help students explore details (Curriculum, Instructor, Outcomes, Pricing, etc.)


Everything should be mobile-first, then scale to desktop.

1️⃣ FOLD 1 – HERO (TOP OF PAGE)
1.1 Structure & Order (MUST follow this exactly)
Inside the main container (same max-width for all sections):
Header bar (already exists):


Left: Bcalm wordmark


Right: Free Resources pill CTA


Hero content, in this order:


Headline


Subheadline


Primary CTA


Social proof


Cohort info line


Secondary inline links (Schedule + Readiness)


Then a breathing gap before next section.


1.2 Visual Anchor Behind Headline
Add a very subtle gradient/glow behind or around the headline text to create a visual anchor.
Can be a soft radial gradient or blurred “blob” in brand purple/blue.


Low opacity, not distracting.


Purpose: make the hero feel intentional and premium, not just text on a background.


1.3 Hero Copy (Text)
Headline:
Become interview-ready for AI Product roles in 30 days
(Ensure line breaks are clean; don’t split “AI Product roles” awkwardly.)
Subheadline:
Designed for non-tech students & recent graduates.
1.4 Primary CTA (Main Action)
Below the subheadline:
[ Join the Waitlist ]
Solid fill (brand purple gradient or flat purple).


Full-width on mobile, sized nicely on desktop.


This should be the most visually dominant element in the hero.


1.5 Social Proof (AFTER the CTA)
Directly below the primary CTA, add a small social proof element:
🧑‍🎓 Trusted by 200+ students from IITs, BITS, NITs & IIITs
Important:
This comes after the CTA, not before (to avoid interrupting the decision to act).


Style it as:


small text


either a light chip or just inline text


background (if any) should be very light (e.g. bg-purple-50)


no heavy block or big pill like a second button.


1.6 Cohort Info (Small Line, Not a Card)
Under the social proof, show next cohort info as a simple line, not a full card:
📅 Next cohort starts: December 2, 2025
Keep it small, calm, and text-based.


No heavy card, no box shadow.


1.7 Secondary Actions (Inline Links, Very Light)
Under the cohort info:
Schedule a call · Take the AI PM Readiness Check →
Plain text links, no background.


Subtle grey color (e.g. text-gray-400), hover to slightly darker.


Align center on mobile and desktop.


These should not visually compete with the primary CTA.


1.8 Spacing (Vertical Rhythm)
On mobile:
Headline → subheadline: 12–16px


Subheadline → CTA: 16–20px


CTA → social proof: 10–14px


Social proof → cohort line: 8–10px


Cohort line → secondary links row: 8–10px


Secondary links row → next section (Why Bcalm Works): 28–36px


The last gap is key to create a distinct “end” of hero and start of Fold 2.

2️⃣ FOLD 2 – “WHY BCALM WORKS” (PROOF FOLD)
This is immediately below the hero and starts with a section heading.
2.1 Section Heading
Centered within the same container:
Why Bcalm Works
 Built from real hiring experience, real product journeys, and real outcomes.
Heading: larger, semi-bold.


Subtext: smaller, muted grey.


2.2 Two Main Proof Cards
Under the heading, show two stacked cards on mobile, side-by-side on desktop:
Card 1: Instructor – credibility / aspiration


Card 2: 10x Shortlist – tangible career outcome


These should feel like Fold 2 core content, not part of hero.
2.2.1 Card 1 – Instructor (“Learn from a Product Leader”)
Card title:
Learn from a Product Leader
Card content (bullets, max 3):
Built large-scale products at Zepto, Apollo 247, Toppr & Housing.com


Grew his career from ₹3.2 LPA → ₹2.4 Cr PA


Senior Director of Product at a $7B YC-backed company


Design:
Light background (e.g. bg-slate-900 or bg-[#0f172a] if staying dark, or a very soft light tint if you want contrast).


Rounded corners (e.g. 16px).


Soft shadow or border, but lighter than hero CTAs.


On mobile: full-width stack.


On desktop: left card in a two-column grid with equal width.


You can optionally include a small circular instructor photo at the top-left to humanize it.
2.2.2 Card 2 – Shortlist (“10x Your Shortlist Chances”)
Card title:
10x Your Shortlist Chances
Card content (bullets, max 3):
Learn how to craft a resume tailored for AI/PM roles, not generic applications


Build a portfolio that proves you can solve real product problems


Use insider hiring signals most candidates never see to stand out in shortlisting


Design:
 Same card style as Card 1 for visual consistency.
2.3 Layout & Spacing
On mobile:
Section heading → subtext: 8–12px


Subtext → Card 1: 20–24px


Card 1 → Card 2: 16–20px


Card 2 → Quicklinks (Fold 3): 24–32px


On desktop:
Heading centered at top


Two cards side-by-side in a responsive grid (grid-cols-2 on md+, grid-cols-1 on mobile)


Same vertical spacing above/below.



3️⃣ FOLD 3 – QUICKLINKS / SUB-NAV
The quicklinks help students jump to the parts they care about after they’ve already seen:
what Bcalm is (hero)


why it’s legit for them (Fold 2)


3.1 Quicklinks Placement
Place quicklinks after the two cards, as a new, slim strip.
Two possible implementations – choose A if possible, B if you want simpler for v1.

Option A – Sticky Sub-Nav (Preferred)
Behavior:
Quicklinks row appears below the cards like a normal section.


As the user scrolls down and this row reaches the top of the viewport, it becomes sticky (fixed at top) beneath the main header.


Row content (links):
Overview · Curriculum · Instructor · Outcomes · Reviews · Pricing · FAQ
Each link scrolls to an anchor (#overview, #curriculum, etc.).


On mobile, this can be a horizontally scrollable row of pills or text links.


Design:
Height: ~44–48px.


Background: solid (e.g. same as page background).


Border-bottom: very light (e.g. border-b border-slate-800 if dark).


Text: small, muted by default; darker on hover/active.


Active tab: slightly bolder or underlined.


Row content as above.
Interaction:
Each link is an anchor to a section further down.


Styling: small, inline, center-aligned, subtle bottom border or spacing.



4️⃣ ACCESSIBILITY, COGNITIVE LOAD & MENTAL MODELS
Please consciously design for:
4.1 Cognitive Flow
User first understands: “Is this for me?” (hero text)


Then sees what to do: “Join the Waitlist.”


Then sees reassurance: “Trusted by students like me; there’s a concrete cohort date.”


Then sees: “Why should I believe this program?” → Instructor + Shortlist cards.


THEN: “Let me explore in detail” → quicklinks.


Do not surface extra blocks/cards in the hero above the fold.
4.2 Visual Simplicity
Only one solid primary CTA in the hero.


Everything else should use lighter backgrounds, smaller fonts, or inline text.


Avoid more than one heavy block per fold.


4.3 Mobile-first
Ensure all text wraps nicely and nothing overflows.


Test on 375px width viewport.


Full-width cards on mobile, grid on desktop.
