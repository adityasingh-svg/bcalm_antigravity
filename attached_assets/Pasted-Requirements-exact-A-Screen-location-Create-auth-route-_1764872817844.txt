Requirements (exact)

A) Screen location

Create /auth route/page (usable for both mweb and dweb).

If my app currently opens auth as a modal, keep that behavior but render the same UI from a shared component so it looks identical everywhere.

B) Layout

Centered card, max-width 420px.

Clear separation from background:

Card background must be lighter than page background

Subtle border + soft shadow to lift it.

Vertical spacing and hierarchy exactly like:

Logo

Headline + subtext

Google button (primary)

small “or”

Email field

Password field

Continue button (primary)

helper links row

footer tiny text

C) Copy (use only these strings)

Headline: Welcome to BCALM

Subtext: Sign in to continue

Google button: Continue with Google

Separator: or

Email label: Email

Email placeholder: you@example.com

Password label: Password

Password placeholder: Enter password

Primary CTA: Continue

Helper link left: New here? Create account

Helper link right: Forgot password?

Footer: By continuing you agree to Terms & Privacy

Do not add any other headings, tips, or marketing copy.

D) Behavior

Clicking Continue with Google triggers Supabase Google OAuth and returns to previous page.

Email/password flow:

User enters email + password → clicks Continue.

If email exists → sign in.

If email does not exist → create account automatically with the same password.

Show inline error text only if Supabase returns an error.

“New here? Create account”

This is not a tab. On click, do:

focus email field

show a subtle hint under CTA: We’ll create your account if you’re new.
(exact string, no more)

“Forgot password?”

On click, open a small inline email-only state:

Keep the same card

Hide password field

CTA changes to Send reset link

After success show: Reset link sent
(use only these two strings)

E) Styling

Keep BCALM vibe but improve contrast:

Use existing purple gradient for background.

Card bg: rgba(20, 12, 40, 0.96)

Borders: rgba(255,255,255,0.10)

Inputs: solid dark with clear borders (no transparent “blending”).

Primary buttons: purple gradient, full width.

No extra animations besides a smooth 200ms fade-in when card appears.

F) Files

Add /auth page.

If React: make AuthCard.jsx and reuse it in modal + route.

If Vanilla: make auth.html, auth.css, auth.js and reuse in modal by importing the same HTML block.

Finally, test end-to-end:

Google signup/login works.

Email login for existing user works.

Email signup auto-creates user when new.

Forgot password flow sends reset email.

No extra copy exists beyond what I specified.
