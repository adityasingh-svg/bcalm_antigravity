Update my existing BCALM Replit app (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend, Node/Express backend).
Goal: add a desktop-only floating CTA pill on the right mid-screen that appears after a small scroll, is dismissible, and routes into the CV flow.
IMPORTANT: Do not add or invent any new copy anywhere. Use only the strings below. If a label is required and I didn’t specify it, leave it blank.

Behavior requirements (exact)

The floating pill must render ONLY on desktop (min-width: 1024px).

It must NOT appear on mobile or tablet.

The pill must be hidden on initial page load.

It should fade + slide in once when the user scrolls down 15–20% of the page height (use 18%).

After appearing, it stays fixed while scrolling.

The pill must be dismissible via a small “×” icon in the top-right of the pill.

On dismiss: hide pill immediately.

Persist dismissal using localStorage key bcalm_cta_dismissed_until with a timestamp.

Do not show again for 7 days if dismissed.

If the user clicks the CTA button in the pill, it must trigger the same flow as the main hero CTA (whatever function/router you already use for “get free cv score / start flow”).

After click, the pill should disappear.

Once the user enters onboarding or upload (any route starting /onboarding or /upload or /app), do not render the pill.

Copy requirements (exact, no additions)

Inside the floating pill:

1-line copy text:
Get a clear CV review

1 CTA button text:
Check my CV

Dismiss icon: text must be exactly × (no tooltip, no aria-label copy).

No other text should be added to the pill.

Layout & styling requirements

Position:

Fixed on the right side.

Vertically centered but slightly lower: top: 58% with transform translateY(-58%).

Right offset: 24px.

Size:

Width: 260px max, auto height.

Visual style:

Rounded corners 16px.

Background slightly lighter than page background (use rgba white overlay).

Soft shadow.

Low visual dominance (should feel like a calm reminder, not an ad).

Button full width.

No pulsing or bouncing animations. Only a single fade/slide-in on first reveal.

Hover:

Underline text on hover.

Button hover should slightly brighten.

Implementation details

Add HTML for pill into the landing page (home page) template:

Wrap it in a div with id desktopFloatingCTA.

Include:

copy text element

CTA button

dismiss icon

Add JS in a new file public/floating-cta.js and load it only on home page.

JS must:

compute scroll percentage

reveal pill at 18% scroll

respect localStorage dismissal

hide pill on dismiss for 7 days

call existing hero CTA click handler on button click

Add CSS in public/styles.css (or your main home CSS file):

Ensure desktop-only via media query @media (min-width: 1024px)

Provide fade/slide transition

Files to modify/create

Home page HTML (likely public/index.html or template used for /)

add floating pill markup at end of body

load floating-cta.js

public/floating-cta.js (create)

public/styles.css (or existing landing CSS)

Keep code minimal, readable, and consistent with my current structure.
Again: no extra copy beyond the exact two strings above.
