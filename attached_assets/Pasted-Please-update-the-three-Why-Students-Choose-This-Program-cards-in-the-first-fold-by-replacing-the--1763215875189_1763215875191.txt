Please update the three “Why Students Choose This Program” cards in the first fold by replacing the old single-sentence text in each card with a two-part structure:

A short micro-heading (bold or slightly larger)

One concise, high-impact sentence

Highlight ONLY the exact proof-words specified below — do not highlight anything else.

This change improves scannability and visual hierarchy while keeping the hero section clean and uncluttered.

🔄 Replace each card’s text with the EXACT content and highlight instructions below:
CARD 1 — INSTRUCTOR
Micro-Heading (bold):

Learn From the Leader Behind 500+ PM Interviews

Sentence (with required highlights):

“Get trained by a Product Leader who has conducted 500+ PM interviews and shaped the decisions behind 30–40 PM offers.”

Highlight ONLY these exact phrases:

500+ PM interviews

30–40 PM offers

Do not highlight any other text in this card.

CARD 2 — SHORTLISTING
Micro-Heading (bold):

10x Your Shortlist Chances

Sentence (with required highlights):

“Use insider hiring criteria to craft a resume and AI PM portfolio that gets you 10x more shortlists than typical applicants.”

Highlight ONLY these exact phrases:

insider hiring criteria

AI PM portfolio

10x more shortlists

Do not highlight any other text in this card.

CARD 3 — COHORT QUALITY
Micro-Heading (bold):

Selective, High-Quality Cohort

Sentence (with required highlights):

“We handpick a limited cohort so every student gets personal attention, deeper mentorship, and a high-caliber peer group.”

Highlight ONLY these exact phrases:

handpick a limited cohort

personal attention

high-caliber peer group

Do not highlight any other text in this card.

🎨 Design & Placement Instructions (Important):

Keep the hero section clean, readable, and uncluttered.

Place these three cards exactly where they currently are: below the CTA buttons and above the navigation tabs / metric badges.

Maintain the current card layout, spacing, and icons — just replace the copy and apply the specified highlights.

Micro-headings should stand out subtly but must not overpower the hero title.
