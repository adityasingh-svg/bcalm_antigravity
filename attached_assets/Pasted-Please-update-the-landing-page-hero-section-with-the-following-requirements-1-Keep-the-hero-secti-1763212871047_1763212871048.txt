Please update the landing page hero section with the following requirements:

1. Keep the hero section clean, uncluttered, and highly readable.

Do not overload the title, subtitle, or CTAs.
Maintain ample whitespace and visual balance.

2. Use this exact hero title:

“Become Interview-Ready for AI Product Roles in Just 30 Days”

3. Use this short subtitle:

“Designed for Non-Tech Students & Graduates”

4. Keep the primary CTAs exactly where they are:

ADD THIS NEW ELEMENT IN THE FIRST FOLD: THE TOP 3 REASONS TO ENROLL

Place a new section immediately below the CTA buttons and above the navigation tabs / metric badges.

This new section should be visually subtle and premium.
It should enhance the hero, not crowd it.

Section Heading:

“Why Students Choose This Program”

Use these exact three reasons as three separate cards/badges:

“Learn from the Product Leader who has interviewed 500+ candidates and knows exactly what gets you hired.”

“Get 10x more shortlists with a resume and portfolio engineered using insider hiring criteria from real AI PM recruiters.”

“We handpick a small group of highly motivated students so every learner gets personal attention, deeper mentorship, and a high-quality peer group.”

Layout Instructions (very important):

Let the system decide the most impactful layout (horizontal cards, badges, mini-panels, or icons), but ensure:

The hero section must remain clean and visually premium

The three reasons should be placed in the first fold

They should look distinct, readable, and high-value

They should NOT steal visual focus from the main hero title

They should appear as supporting validation, not clutter

On desktop → display them horizontally

On mobile → stack them vertically for readability

Design Tone:

Premium

Tech-forward

Clean

Aspirational for college students

Avoid heavy blocks or dense text

Use brand’s own accent colors for subtle highlights

Narrative Intent (VERY IMPORTANT):

The story should be crystal-clear to any student viewing the first fold:

This program is for them (non-tech students & grads)

The promise is strong and trustworthy (interview-ready in 30 days)

The top 3 reasons instantly prove credibility & exclusivity

The layout must visually communicate trust, quality, and seriousness

Make sure the visual hierarchy supports this narrative.
