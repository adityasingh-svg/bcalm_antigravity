Build a high-conversion HERO SECTION (first fold) for a website called “Bcalm”, inspired by the visual style of Seekho’s hero at seekhoapp.com.

Goal: Convert cold traffic into email signups for a FREE AI-powered CV Score and 30-day interview plan.

Technical requirements:
- Use ONLY HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript in a single file.
- Mobile-first, but should scale nicely on desktop.
- All CSS in a <style> tag in the same file.
- All JavaScript in a <script> tag at the bottom of the file.
- Use Google Fonts (Poppins or Inter).
- No external frameworks (no Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc).

Overall visual style (copy Seekho’s hero feel):
- Full-width hero, centered content.
- Dark background with a subtle overlay (can use a dark purple gradient).
- Large, bold, center-aligned headline in white.
- Short subheadline below it.
- A pill-shaped badge above the headline (like Seekho’s “India’s No.1 Edutainment App”).
- Single strong primary CTA button, large pill, centered.
- A trust line + college logos / chips under the CTA.
- Use smooth drop shadows, rounded corners, and gradients similar to Seekho’s “Download App” button.

CONTENT (use EXACT text below):

Top badge (centered pill):
- Text: “India’s Fastest-Growing Interview Prep Platform”

Main headline (two lines, center):
- Line 1: “Crack Your Dream Job”
- Line 2: “in 30 Days”

Subheadline (center, single line):
- “Free AI CV Score + 30-Day Personalized Plan”

Primary CTA button (big pill, centered, gradient):
- Text: “Get My Free CV Score”

Trust line and proof (below CTA):
- Line: “Trusted by Students from IITs, BITS, NITs & IIMs”
- Under this, show 4 small pill chips: “IIT”, “BITS”, “NIT”, “IIM”
- Under the chips, show 3 small circular avatar placeholders and the text: “200+ success stories”

Below the hero text (still in view on most screens), add a centered CARD that contains a 2-step form:

Form card design:
- Slightly lighter dark background than the page.
- Soft border + shadow so it “floats”.
- Rounded corners (large radius).
- Max width ~420px, centered.
- Add a small progress bar at the top of the card.

Step 1 (shown initially):
- Title at top of card: “Step 1 of 2 · Get your FREE CV Score”
- Horizontal progress bar filled to 50%.
- Fields:
  - Email (required) with placeholder “name@gmail.com”
  - Target Role (dropdown) with options: “Product Ma
