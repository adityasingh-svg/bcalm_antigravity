1. Entry Points & Nudges
1.1 From main landing hero

Below your primary CTA (“Join the Waitlist”), add a secondary text link:

“Not sure if you’re ready yet?
Take the AI PM Readiness Check →”

Small, under the buttons, but clearly visible.

Clicking opens /ai-pm-readiness in the same tab.

Why?
You capture the “I’m curious but not fully sold yet” segment and convert them into leads via assessment.

1.2 From Free Resources header

Under Free Resources, list:

AI PM Readiness Check

Free Resume Template

Free AI PM Interview Questions (future)

Readiness Check is top of the list. It links to the same route /ai-pm-readiness.

1.3 From direct link (social, WhatsApp, communities)

Use a short URL like:

bcalm.in/ai-pm-readiness

This should resolve to the same assessment landing page (not directly into questions), so expectations are set.

2. Assessment Landing Page ( /ai-pm-readiness )
Goal

Make them want to invest ~10 minutes and accept signup as reasonable.

Content structure

Hero:

AI PM Readiness Check
Are you ready for AI Product roles? Find your strengths, gaps, and a clear learning path.

Subtext:

Designed for 3rd–4th year students and recent graduates. 24 questions · 10 minutes · instant personalized report.

Primary CTA:

Start My Readiness Check

Secondary link:

“Already have an account? Log in →”

Below the fold:

3 short benefit bullets:

“See where you stand across 8 AI PM skills”

“Get a personalized gap report + learning recommendations”

“Understand how top students move from ‘curious’ to ‘role-ready’”

Tiny reassurance at bottom:

“You’ll need a free Bcalm account so we can save your report and email it to you.”

Behavior:

If user is logged in, Start My Readiness Check → /ai-pm-readiness/start

If not logged in, Start My Readiness Check → signup modal with redirect (next section).

3. Auth & Signup Flow

Constraint: “If user is not logged in, they must sign up before starting or seeing results.”

We’ll do it in a way that feels logical, not spammy.

3.1 Signup entry

When user clicks Start My Readiness Check and is not authenticated:

Open a modal (or full-page on mobile) with:

Title:

Create your free Bcalm account

Subtext:

We’ll save your readiness report, email it to you, and let you track your progress over time.

Fields:

Name

Email

Password

(Optional) “Year” (3rd / 4th / Graduated)

(Optional) “Background” (Non-tech / CS/IT / Other Engineering / Other)

Buttons:

Continue (primary)

“Already have an account? Log in” (link toggles to login mode)

Critical detail:
Store intended redirect (/ai-pm-readiness/start) in state or query param so after signup/login you go straight into the assessment, not back to landing.

3.2 Why signup before questions is okay here

You’re giving a 10-minute, personalized report. Asking for signup upfront is reasonable if:

You explain why (“we’ll save your report, you can revisit it, and we’ll email you a copy”)

The form is short and supports social login (Google) to reduce friction.

If you can, definitely add:

Button: “Continue with Google”

This alone will dramatically boost start rate.

4. Assessment-Taking UX

Route: /ai-pm-readiness/start ➜ /ai-pm-readiness/questions

Primary goals:

Minimize friction per question

Maintain a sense of progress & purpose

Use student language from our earlier tailored questions

4.1 Intro screen (once user is authenticated)

Before question 1, show a short intro page:

You’re about to start your AI PM Readiness Check
24 questions · 8 skill areas · ~10 minutes

Answer honestly. This is for you, not a test. Your responses stay private.

CTA:

Begin Assessment

Secondary:

“I’ll do this later” (goes back to landing/dashboard)

This mentally commits them.

4.2 Question UI

One question per screen (especially important on mobile).

Show section name and overall progress:

Example:

Section: Product & Problem Thinking
Question 3 of 24

Then the statement, e.g.:

“I can take a vague problem (e.g., ‘students struggle to find internships’) and turn it into a clear, specific problem statement.”

Scale as buttons, not dropdown:

Not yet, this is new to me

I’ve heard of this but can’t really use it

I understand basics but need guidance to apply it

I can apply this in projects with some help

I can do this confidently and explain it to others

Interactions:

Tapping an option:

Immediately records the answer

Auto-advances to the next question after ~200–300ms subtle delay (to avoid “I tapped wrong” frustration)

Allow small “Back” chevron to adjust previous question if needed.

At the bottom, show a thin progress bar filling from 0–100%.

4.3 Autosave & exit

Implementation detail:

Save answers in local state + periodically POST to backend (/api/assessment/attempt/{id}).

If the user refreshes or closes mid-way:

Resume from last answered question when they return within X hours (say 24h).

Show “Resume your readiness check?” screen if they revisit /ai-pm-readiness.

This helps massively with completion rate.

5. Results Experience
5.1 Backend scoring

On completion:

Calculate:

Per-dimension scores (8 domains; each 3 questions → /15)

Total score (/120)

Readiness band (Early Explorer / Building Foundation / On Track / Internship Ready)

Save as a AssessmentAttempt entity with:

user_id

scores JSON by dimension

total

band

timestamp

a public share token (e.g., short UUID separate from user ID)

5.2 Redirect

On completion, immediately redirect to:

/ai-pm-readiness/results/{attemptId}

This is the personal results page (requires login).

5.3 Personal result page layout (logged-in view)

Above the fold:

Badge:

Your AI PM Readiness Score

Big score:

92 / 120 – Building Foundation 📚

1–2 line summary tailored to band:

“You’re early in your AI PM journey. You already show strength in [X], but need to build foundations in [Y] and [Z] to become internship-ready.”

Buttons:

Primary: “See how to close these gaps with Bcalm →” (scrolls down or goes to curriculum section)

Secondary: “Download my detailed report (PDF)”

Next section – Radar / bar chart:

Show all 8 dimensions with color-coded bars:

Green: 12–15 (strong)

Amber: 9–11 (developing)

Red: 0–8 (gap)

Below – Gap-based explanation

For each dimension where score < 10:

Product & Problem Thinking — Needs Work
You scored 7 / 15 here. This usually means you:

Struggle to crisply define user problems

Jump to solutions without clear outcomes

Find it hard to choose what to prioritize

Then:

How Bcalm helps you with this:
In Module 1: Product & Problem Thinking for AI, you will…
• Practice writing problem statements from vague prompts
• Learn how to define success metrics
• Work on structured case prompts similar to AI PM interviews

Do this mapping for each weak dimension. This is where Bcalm sells itself without feeling salesy.

End of page: contextual CTA

Based on band:

Early Explorer / Building Foundation:

“You’re exactly who Bcalm was designed for. Join the next cohort to move from 60s → 100+.”

CTA: See Program Curriculum / Join Waitlist

On Track / Internship Ready:

“You’re close. Bcalm helps you turn this into a standout portfolio & interview success.”

CTA: See Student Projects / Join Next Cohort

6. Shareable Results (Lead Gen Loop)

We want a version they can share on LinkedIn/WhatsApp that:

doesn’t leak private answers

advertises Bcalm

entices others to take the assessment

6.1 Public share URL

Generate URL like:

/ai-pm-readiness/share/{publicToken}

This should NOT require login.

It should show:

First name + initial (or just first name)

Band + score range (not exact, if you prefer)

A stylized card saying:

“I just completed the Bcalm AI PM Readiness Check
and scored Building Foundation 📚
Want to see where you stand? Take the assessment → [bcalm.in/ai-pm-readiness]”

Add a “Take the AI PM Readiness Check” button on this share page that:

Redirects to /ai-pm-readiness

If not logged in → triggers signup flow as before.

6.2 Share CTA on personal results page

On the logged-in results page, add:

Share your readiness profile

Buttons:

Share to LinkedIn (pre-filled post text)

Copy link

Share to WhatsApp (mobile deep link)

Keep this clearly optional; no gating.

7. Implementation Details (High-Level)
7.1 Routes

/ai-pm-readiness → Landing/overview

/ai-pm-readiness/start → Auth guard + intro

/ai-pm-readiness/questions → Question runner

/ai-pm-readiness/results/:attemptId → Personal result (requires auth + ownership)

/ai-pm-readiness/share/:token → Public share view (no auth)

7.2 Auth guard logic

Any access to /questions or /results/:attemptId:

If not authenticated → redirect to /auth?redirect=/ai-pm-readiness/start

Access to /share/:token:

Always allowed; uses token to fetch safe subset of result.

7.3 Data model (simplified)

User

id, name, email, year, background, created_at, etc.

AssessmentAttempt

id

user_id

scores_by_dimension (JSON)

total_score

band

created_at

public_share_token (nullable)

AssessmentAnswer (optional, if you want granular data)

id

attempt_id

question_id

answer_value (1–5)

7.4 Tracking & optimisation

Instrument:

assessment_landing_viewed

assessment_start_clicked

signup_completed_for_assessment

assessment_started

assessment_completed

result_viewed

share_clicked (by channel)

cta_clicked_from_results (join waitlist, view curriculum, etc.)

This lets you test:

Where drop-off happens

Whether signup-before-questions is hurting completion (if yes, consider “name + email only” as a lighter first step in future)
