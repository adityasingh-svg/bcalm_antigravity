Build a high-conversion mobile-first landing page (only the first fold / hero section) for a product called “Bcalm”. Bcalm helps students and early-career professionals become interview-ready and crack their dream job.

Overall requirements:
- Use clean HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only. No frameworks.
- Design must be mobile-first, but also look great on desktop.
- Use a modern, minimal style. Background can be a subtle dark purple gradient, but keep plenty of contrast and whitespace so text is easy to read.
- Primary brand colors: deep purple for background, bright violet for primary button, and orange accents. Use white text for contrast.
- Put all styles in a <style> tag in the same file and JS in a <script> tag at the bottom.

Layout:
1. Top navigation bar:
   - Left: Bcalm logo placeholder (simple graduation cap icon + “BCALM” text).
   - Right: a small text link “Login” (no other CTAs in the navbar).
   - Navbar must be sticky at the top.

2. Hero section (first fold):
   - Main headline (large, bold):
     “Crack Your Dream Job in 30 Days — Guaranteed”
   - Sub-headline (smaller, but still prominent):
     “Get a FREE AI-powered CV Score + a personalised interview roadmap for the role you want.”
   - Founder credibility line under the sub-headline in smaller font:
     “Created by IIT Delhi & IIM Calcutta founders who’ve hired 500+ candidates.”
   - Social proof row ABOVE the main CTA:
     - Text: “Trusted by students from”
     - Show placeholder logos for: IIT Delhi, BITS Pilani, NIT, IIM (simple rectangles with text labels are fine).
   - Under the logos, show a small row of 3 circular placeholder student photos (use colored circles or stock avatars) with a caption:
     “+200 success stories and counting”

3. Primary CTA area (multi-step, email first, resume second):
   - Centered card with a subtle shadow.
   - Step indicator text at the top of the card: “Step 1 of 2 · Get your FREE CV Score”
   - Inside Step 1:
     - Input fields: Full Name, Email, Target Role (text input or dropdown with a few roles like “Product Manager, Data Analyst, Software Engineer”).
     - Primary button: “Get Free CV Score”
   - When the user clicks “Get Free CV Score”, prevent page reload and:
     - Hide Step 1 fields.
     - Change the step indicator to: “Step 2 of 2 · Upload your CV”
     - Show a file upload field labelled “Upload Resume (PDF or DOCX)” with helper text “We’ll analyze your CV and email you a detailed score & roadmap.”
     - Change the button text to: “Submit CV”
   - After Step 2 submit, just show a success state in the card: a green tick icon + text “You’re in! We’ll email your CV Score and roadmap within 24 hours.” No real backend, just front-end behavior.

4. Micro-copy for urgency and reassurance:
   - Under the main CTA card, show a small line:
     “🎉 37 students joined this week · Limited FREE CV scoring slots today”
   - Add another subtle reassurance line:
     “No spam. We only email you your report and next steps.”

5. Remove distractions:
   - Do NOT include any “Practice Interviews” button or secondary CTA in the hero section.
   - The only main action in the hero fold should be “Get Free CV Score” leading into the 2-step flow.

6. Sticky mobile CTA:
   - On mobile screens, add a sticky bottom bar that is always visible while scrolling.
   - The bar should contain: short text “Get FREE CV Score” and a button “Start Now”.
   - Clicking this sticky bar should smoothly scroll to the CTA card in the hero section.

7. Exit-intent popup:
   - Add a simple exit-intent popup implemented with vanilla JS.
   - When the user moves the mouse toward the top of the window (or after ~20 seconds on mobile), show a centered modal with:
     - Title: “Wait! Don’t leave without your FREE CV Score”
     - Text: “Get a free AI-powered CV Score and personalised interview roadmap in under 2 minutes.”
     - Email input + button “Get Free CV Score”
   - If the user submits here, just show a thank-you message in the modal.
   - Include a close (X) icon at the top right of the modal.

8. General design notes:
   - Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or system font).
   - Make the headline large and readable on mobile.
   - Ensure all buttons have hover and active states.
   - Add smooth scrolling behavior for internal links.
   - Make sure the hero section fills at least the full viewport height on desktop and mobile so it feels like a complete first fold.

Please output a single, complete HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript that implements this Bcalm hero section exactly as described, optimized for high conversion of traffic to signups.
