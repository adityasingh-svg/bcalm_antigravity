Here is a **ready-to-paste Replit prompt** that will generate a **mobile-first, responsive landing page** for **Vibecoding**, styled similar to BCALM’s UI, but with an **orange hero theme**, and a strong CTA **“Enroll Now”**.
The prompt tells Replit AI exactly what to build — layout, sections, responsiveness, design rules, fonts, animations, everything.
